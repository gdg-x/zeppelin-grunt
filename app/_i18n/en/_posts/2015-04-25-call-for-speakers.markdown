#### General Guidelines

Riada & Atlassian Enterprise Day sessions are intended to provide attendees with valuable takeaways to help their teams work smarter. We're looking for great examples of how Atlassian products empower better ways of working together.<br/>

#### Enterprise Day 2015 focus areas

##### Innovate

Kick-ass agile teams relentlessly pursue innovation in their products and collaboration in their offices. Discover new ways to understand your end users, design a better experience for them, and work better as a team to deliver it with the sessions in this track.

##### Scale

If you're ready to take your Atlassian deployment to the next level, these sessions are for you. Get practical tips for end-user adoption, administration, and growing your infrastructure from Atlassian teams and customers who've successfully scaled their investment in the Atlassian stack.

##### Service

Learn how IT teams are delivering excellent (and effortless) service to their fellow employees with best practices for incident management, self-service, and knowledge management. And did you know back-office teams like HR and legal are embracing ITSM practices? This ain't your father's service desk.

##### Share & Learn

Learn how Atlassian and Atlassian customers use tools and processes to connect distributed teams, share knowledge, and collaborate in real time. You know that saying about working smarter instead of working harder?... Yeah: it's like that.


#### Successful Submissions

Not every submission can be selected due to tight schedule. Strong speaker submissions feature:

* Actionable takeaways for attendees. What is the tangible impact of your talk on attendees and their teams?
* Who would benefit the most from your presentation?
* Unique or innovative application of an Atlassian product
* Engaging, inspiring, and fun delivery
